  <p>THE KAYA GIRL </p>
  <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>

  <p> "Hi!"I said.
  There was no reply.
  "3te s3n?" I said in Twi
  Still, she was quiet.She looked frustrated with herself for not being able to reply.
  she gave a shy smile to show she did not intend to be rude,and lowered her large metal bowl. I smiled back and, suddenly,language did not seem important.it was as if we knew each other already.</p>
   <p>"Abena, stop wasting time and bring her inside," my aunt called from inside the shop. "She is here to carry things,not to chat with you.Hey,small girl, bra!" she finished off brusquely,ordering the girl inside with a curl of her fingers.</p>

   <p>The girl hurried in carrying her oversize metal bowl before her, and placed it at auntie Lydia's feet.As she bent down, I could see that her eye was caught by the gleamingfrench manicure on auntie's long, pointy toenails. With eyes still lowered, she collected the six bulging shoppping bags fromt the fat customer with the eight rings on her fingers was arranged them deftly inside her bowl. This was the awkward moment because she needed help but did not know how to ask for it. I rushed over and grabbed the rim of the bowl, to help lift it onto her head. We struggled a bit as it tipped precariously in my direction. Then it was up, sitting snugly on the flattened pad on her head, a faded scarf rolled into a cloth snail shell.</p>

   <p>As we did this, a new customer entered the shop, immaculate in a white lace Anago wrapper and top,with a red and gold gele on her head. It was so gorgeously folded and tied that i resolved there and then to go to the shop next door and beg the Nigerian lady to teach me how to do it.Auntie was mesmerized too, so I look advantage and slipped out, following the girl with the huge bowl on her head.</p>

   <p>I could not believe how straight and fast she walked with that weight on her head. I imagined that if we had put it on my head instead, my whole neck would have been pushed down into my chest and my knees would have collapsed into my feet. We walked in single file, Auntie's customer who had now become the girl's, leading the way towards her car, the girl following and me, unseen, bringing up the rear. I did not really know why i was following. I didn't think about that till later:; a few hours later and then, many years later.</p>
   <p> A few hours later, I thought i had probably done it becuase i was getting bored spending all day everyday at Auntie's shop. Mummy had travelled to London to have baby and Daddy was busy with work and Auntie Lydia had offered to have me for the long vacation.</P>
